THA 2.2
closest relative type strain is Stenotrophomonas rhizophila DSM 14405
but with a d0/d4/d6 values (=digital DDH value) ranging from 67.5 -
79.6 it is just
bouncing around 70% which is considered the threshold for a new species.
There is a little chance given that it is a new species, but most
likely it is a S. rhizophila

RSB 5.4
Here the d4-dDDH value is about 40% which also tells us that it is
definitively a NEW and not yet described Pseudomonas species !!


RSB 5.11
by 16S and whole genome sequence gives a super definitive statement: this is a
for sure a Pseudomonas tolaasii

In Combined run data

ASV18 matches RSB5.4 (P1)
ASV9 matches THA2.2 (P2)
ASV10 matches RSB5.11 (P3)
